Subject: Sick Leave Request

Dear [Supervisor's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to formally request sick leave for [number of days] starting from [start date] to [end date] due to [brief reason for your illness, e.g., a health issue, medical condition, etc.].

I will ensure that all my responsibilities are managed during my absence and will keep you updated on my progress. If necessary, I am available via email for any urgent matters.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,
